# Heart-Disease-Predictor

The Heart Disease Prediction Web Application is a project aimed at predicting the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various input parameters. This project provides an interactive and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to explore the predictions by adjusting the input parameters.

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, and early detection plays a vital role in preventing adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can effectively analyze medical data and identify patterns that help in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. This web application leverages a trained SVM model to make predictions based on user-provided inputs.

Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface: The web application has an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily interact with the prediction system.
2. Input Parameter Selection: Users can adjust various parameters related to age, gender, medical measurements, and other risk factors through interactive sliders and inputs.
3. Real-Time Predictions: As users modify the input parameters, the web application dynamically calculates and displays the predicted likelihood of heart disease.

By utilizing this web application, users can gain insights into their heart disease risk and make informed decisions about their health. It serves as a valuable tool for individuals, healthcare professionals, and researchers interested in understanding and predicting heart disease.

Technologies Used:

1. Streamlit: Streamlit is an open-source Python library used for building interactive web applications. It provides a simple and elegant way to create user interfaces for machine learning models and data analysis tasks.
2. Python: The application is developed using Python programming language, which is widely used for machine learning, data analysis, and web development.
3. Machine Learning (ML) Model: The heart disease prediction model used in this application is built using machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from scikit-learn library. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing relevant features and corresponding heart disease outcomes.
